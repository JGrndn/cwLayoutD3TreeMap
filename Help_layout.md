## Description
The Treemap layout allows to display data according 2 axis. It gather objects (depending a value of their attribute) and organize them on a chart. The size of the objects depends on the value of another attribute.  

## Installation  
[https://github.com/casewise/cpm/wiki](https://github.com/casewise/cpm/wiki)  

## How to set up the treemap layout  
First you need to create the following page structure. ![Configuration](https://github.com/JGrndn/cwLayoutD3TreeMap/blob/master/screen/1.JPG)  
_Please note you can display the treemap without using tabs in your page._  

Then you need to fullfill the options **Group by property** and **Size/Volume** with the property scriptnames (lowercase). There is no constraint with the **Group by property**. However the **Size/Volume** property need to be an integer property.  

Once the configuration is set up, deploy your website (don't forget to deploy themes too !)  

## Result  
Below is a screenshot of what you get once your treemap is correctly configured

You can click on a group of object to zoom-in. To zoom-out, click on the black ribbon above the chart.
